      <h3>Risks and Responsibilities:</h3>
      <p>
        I am aware of the potential hazards associated with traveling in Nepal, as emergency aid may not be accessible and Easy Motorbike not be held accountable for any harm or damage. I will ensure to have my driver’s license and international driving permit with me at all times. A failure to present them to the authorities may result in fines. I will also comply with traffic regulations and utilize protective gear while operating a vehicle. I will not ride while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
      </p>

      <h3>Cancellation Policy:</h3>
      <p>
        I acknowledge that payments for Rental / Tour bookings are non-refundable. If I cancel my trip/tour for any reason after the booking or departure (such as illness, fatigue, accident, etc.) I will not get the refund. Additionally, no refunds will be provided for any unused services.
      </p>

      <h3>Insurance:</h3>
      <p>
        Insurance is generally not provided by motorbike rental companies in Nepal for rental motorbikes. If any incidents such as accidents, scratches, damage to other vehicles or property, injuries, or death occurs during the rental period, insurance would not cover them. The individual renters will be fully responsible for any such incidents and will be liable to pay for them.
      </p>

      <h3>Bike Damage:</h3>
      <p>
        Upon returning the bike, it must be in the same condition as it was received, along with documents. If the bike is damaged (such as broken parts, theft, scratches, punctures, accidents, or issues with the police), the cost of repairs will be the responsibility of the person who rented the bike. If I am unable to return the bike, documents, I will be responsible for all costs related to its return, including those for mechanics, guides, transportation, food, and accommodation.
